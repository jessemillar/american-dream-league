## Project Presentation Notes

- Show pictures (like the ER diagram)
- Give a demo of the project
- We were supposed to pick one aspect of databases that we were interested in as a part of this project (maybe show that off)
- Not a lot of slides with bullet points
- Show what you learned
- If we completed the project and fulfilled all the requirements, our presentation will probably be somewhere around 15 minutes (longer than 10, shorter than 15)
